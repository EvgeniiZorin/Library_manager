This is an early version of an application for managing your books!

In essence, this is what happens:
1) You have a file (e.g. `Library.tsv`), where you record the books you have in your collection. You make records in the following way: `Author name\tBook name\tLanguage available`, where instead of `\t` you press the Tab key :) ; 
2a) Run the script `GUI.py` (if you want to run it in the interpreter) or
2b) Convert the script into an executable by using pyinstaller: `pyinstaller -w GUI.py`

The following features are already available:
- Print all authors;
- Print all books available;
- Print all books by a specified author;
- More features incoming...

This project is version controlled with Git and Github.
